                Welcome to Caldwell Hotels - I've heard your interested in our website and how we operate so lets get to it.
                Our website is running on the fastest localdb I can find, it features 4 unique tables as listed
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Persons Table - Responsible for knowing all about you, it contains a variety of contact information based strings and a primary key  </li>
                <li>RoomStyles Table - Feauturing a numbered list that describes each room variant based on its accomadations</li>
                <li>Rooms Table - Contains generic room information such as whether the room is easily accessible, what floor its on, and links to the RoomStyles table</li>
                <li>Reservation Table - Here is where all the data comes together, by linking People to Rooms, and then linking that to a start and end date, we create an effective record that determines what rooms are avaialble and when. </li>

                In addition to our beautifully hand-crafted database, we've got a modular .html
                setup based in ASP.NET using the MVC architecture. Unfortunately, many of these files are autogenerated
                and aren't worth exploring in detail. The most notable files are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>admin.cshtml - This is our admin panel, responsible for navigating our users to full CRUD functionality for each of our tables  </li>
                <li>ApplicationDBContext.cs - This is what allows our MySql database and Website to effectively communicate. An unhealthy amount of time was spent putting it together. </li>
                <li>The Models Folder - Contains the constructors for our various objects</li>
                <li>Note: The various files in the Models folder and ApplicationDBContext.cs are what I was responsible for migrating to form the effective communication mentioned earlier.</li>
            </ul>
