# COMP2084-CaldwellHotels
The new version of my HotelProject, where I remembered to select authentication!

Caldwell Hotels is a Asp.Net MVC project that aims to allow for virtual reservations of a hotel room. Currently has full CRUD functionality for all included Tables through the Admin panel seen in the navbar.



Its database structure is as follows:

Persons Table - Responsible for contact details.
RoomStyles Table - Responsible for detailed descriptions about the different styles of rooms.
Rooms Table - General room information such as accessability, Floor number.
Reservation Table - Links the Rooms and Persons table with a start and end date to control actual reservation availabiltiy
